          <h2>Hello world!</h2>
          <p>I’m a junior full-stack web developer based out of sunny Orlando, FL.</p>

          <p>In a previous life, I was a Digital Marketing Strategist until I got inspired to build my own landing
          pages and forms and decided to learn web development. More specifically, JavaScript, Node.js, Mongo, React, and React Native.</p>

          <p>When I step away from my computer, you’ll find me with my family and friends. Behind the lens
            of my camera. Attempting to exercise. Or learning something new (I’m an online tutorial junkie. Shh,
            it's our secret.)</p>

          <p>I volunteer too. On weekends I visit assisted living facilities with my dog Fred, who recently got certified
            as a therapy dog.</p>

                <p>Q-less is a web app that allows clients to connect with a bar and place their drink orders.
                At the moment, Q-less, previously known as Drunk Fast (what were we thinking, right?),  offers two main components:
                First, it allows users to access an establishment's drink menu from their phone and place an order.
                Second, it provides establishments a platform to customize their menu and receive orders from their customers via the app.</p>

              <img src="img/phone.png" alt="phone drawing">
              <p>Because most people don’t find it very convenient to take their laptops to the bar, a mobile
                 app was in order here. In this version of Q-less, the focus was on the client (the person
                 purchasing their drinks). Via the app they can gain access to an establishment's drink menu
                 and place an order.</p>

              <p>You're not alone if you studied Spanish for years and now all you remember
                 is Hola. Where did all the knowledge go? Stuffing your brain with large amounts of information
                 at once is not an effective method for long-term retention. Yet, we all do it.
                 But Aprenda Portugues is an application that uses spaced repetition method that helps you retain the knowledge fot the long run.</p>
