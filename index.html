            <h2>Hello world!</h2>
            <p>I’m a full-stack web developer based out of sunny Orlando, FL.</p>

            <p>In a previous life, I was a Digital Marketing Strategist, that was until I got tired of using pre-made
              landing page templates and forms that left little room for customization and improvements.
              The struggle to find the perfect tools for the job inspired me to learn web development.
              More specifically, JavaScript, Node.js, Mongo, React, and React Native.</p>

            <p>When I step away from my computer, you’ll find me with my family and friends, behind the lens
              of my camera, attempting to exercise or learning something new (I’m an online tutorial junkie. Shh,
              it's our secret.)</p>

            <p>I volunteer too. On weekends I visit assisted living facilities with my dog Fred, who recently got certified
              as a therapy dog.</p>

              <p>You're not alone if you studied a second language for years and now all you remember
              is how to say "Hi". Where did all the knowledge go? Stuffing your brain with large amounts of information
              at once is not an effective method for long-term retention. Yet, we all do it.
              But Aprenda Portugues is an application that uses spaced repetition method that helps you retain the knowledge fot the long run.</p>

              <p>Q-less is an app that allows clients to connect with their favorite bar and place their drink orders.
              At the moment, Q-less, previously known as Drunk Fast (what were we thinking, right?), offers two main components:
              First, it allows users to access an establishment's drink menu from their phone and place an order.
              Second, it provides establishments a platform to customize their menu and receive orders from their customers via the app.</p>
